Guided Onboarding
New users are now welcomed with a personalized greeting and guided tour. The tour highlights key parts of the dashboard, explaining what each section does so you can get started quickly.

Contextual Tips
Helpful tips appear throughout the portal, explaining features as you explore. Students see tips about sessions, tasks, and feedback, while mentors and staff see tips relevant to their roles. You can dismiss tips as you learn, and toggle them off entirely from settings.

Live Session Banner
When a session is about to start or in progress, a prominent banner appears on your dashboard. It shows the meeting details, time remaining, and a quick link to join the call or submit meeting prep.

Redesigned Task Creation
Creating a task is now faster with a streamlined dialog. Select priority, status, effort, and due date using compact pill buttons. Staff can assign tasks to any team, and a "Create another" option lets you quickly add multiple tasks.

Session Search
Find sessions faster with a search bar on the sessions page. Type a team name, mentor, or session type to filter the list instantly.

View Grouping Options
Both sessions and tasks now support grouping by status, type, team, or month. Use the Group dropdown to organize your view and find what you need more easily.

Keyboard Shortcuts
Create tasks even faster by pressing Cmd+Enter (or Ctrl+Enter on Windows) to submit the task dialog without clicking.

Help Toggle
Control your onboarding experience from settings. Turn tips on or off globally, or reset all dismissed tips to see them again.
