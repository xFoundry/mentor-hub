Contacts Management
Staff members now have a dedicated Contacts page to view and manage all contacts in the system. Browse the full directory with a fast, responsive table that handles hundreds of contacts smoothly.

Contact Filtering
Quickly find contacts using the search bar, or filter by type (Student, Mentor, Staff, etc.), status (Active, Draft, Archived), or toggle to show only contacts with complete names.

Contact Editing
Click any contact to open a detail panel where you can update their information, including name, email, phone, bio, expertise tags, and social links. Upload or change profile photos with an instant preview.

Role Management
View and edit organizational roles directly from the contact detail panel. Update job titles and organization assignments for each role a contact holds.

Improved Task Board
Dragging tasks between columns on the task board now works more reliably, especially when moving tasks across different status columns.

Staff Task Creation
Staff members can now select any team when creating a new task, making it easier to assign action items across the program.
