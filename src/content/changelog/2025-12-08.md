Multiple Mentors Per Session
Sessions can now include multiple mentors. You'll see all assigned mentors listed, with the lead mentor highlighted.

Improved Email Reminders
Session reminder emails are now more reliable and clearly show times in Eastern Time.

Easier Mentor Management
Staff can now add new mentors or link existing contacts directly from the mentors page, with a searchable directory and expertise tagging.

Editable Session Agendas

Refreshed Feedback Display
Feedback cards have a cleaner look with visual star ratings and organized sections for each type of feedback.
